Another side to this worth considering is that Love Scammers use AI to generate scripts to entice women into relationships that can be exploited. I can spot an AI love message immediately. And my first question to Adam would be 'did you write all of this?'

642,Full,1,TikTok,54,Male,A love letter,Yes,1,1,4,4,3,2,6,3,"I don't believe on the evidence of this episode that Adam is authentic. He also exhibits behaviour that could be described as lazy. However, he must care enough about composing a ''good'' love letter that he asks ChatGPT for help. This could mean he is also a little insecure in his own abilities.","I think I would feel perplexed that Adam was capable of writing a letter like this, and a bit worried that he expresses these feelings only one year into our relationship. I would feel that the text of Adam's letter was inauthentic, due to the grammatical accuracy and lack of 'personality' portrayed in the letter.",5,Yes,2,5

648,Full,1,TikTok,59,Male,A love letter,Yes,1,1,2,4,2,2,2,1,"Adam is lazy and does not understand the value of sincerity in a relationship.
He may laugh it off if his partner found out but I don't think his partner would find it funny.
There is the chance though that Adam is just not very good at expressing his feelings or is not confident in writing. If so I would give him a bit of a pass.",I would feel cheated. I would much prefer a shorter clumsly written letter if I knew he took the time to write it himself.,4,Yes,3,3

However, his letter is not authentic and suggests that he is a little bit lazy.","She may be disappointed. The letter isn't really his writing, so she may not consider the feelings expressed in it to relate to how he really feels. There is a chance she will think less of him for writing the letter.",2,Yes,2,2
